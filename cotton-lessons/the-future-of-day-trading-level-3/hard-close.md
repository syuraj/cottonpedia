# ‚ùé Hard Close

Top level can only be hard closed by the bottom side of the accumulation candle.

(An easier way to remember would be when body of accumulation candle is completely above top level)

Bottom level can only be hard closed by the top side of the distribution candle.

4H level can be hard closed by candle in 4H only and it also confirms hard closing of all timeframes below it (1H, 15min) but not above it (daily).
