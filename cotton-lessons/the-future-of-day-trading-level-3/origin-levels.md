# â­• Origin Levels

A break level becomes Origin level after the first test/touch.

Origin level can be in at the start of peak or valley just like a break level.

Origin level creates a moment of polarity after the first touch and causes breakout in future.

Sometimes origin level can be a swing point and can be used as a BS hold level. So, it shouldn't be deleted even after hard close as price may come back to test it.
