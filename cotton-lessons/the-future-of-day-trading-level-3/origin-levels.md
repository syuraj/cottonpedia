# â­• Origin Levels

A break level becomes Origin level after the first test/touch.

Origin level can be in at the start of peak or valley just like a break level.

Origin level creates a moment of polarity after the first touch and causes breakout in future.

After breakout or hard close, Origin level often turns into BS hold. So, it shouldn't be deleted as price may come back to test it.
