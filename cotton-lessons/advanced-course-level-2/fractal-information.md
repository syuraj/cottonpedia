# ðŸ”» Fractal Information

* Valley - V shaped, Peaks - opposite of V shape
* Use swing highs and lows
* Can act as support and resistance
* **Untested valleys/peaks are important, Big crashes target that**

If the trend reverses before hitting peak bottom, then peak is not really tested.

Inverse level is an opposite level, it can't be opposite if there is nothing to oppose it
