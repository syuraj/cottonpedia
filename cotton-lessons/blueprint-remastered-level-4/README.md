## High Level Summary



#### Misidentifying Odds

If you are playing a 10/10 level at the bottom of a range to the first bounce, then you're completely misidentifying the implied trading odds of that trade.



**Premium & Non Premium Trades**

You also have to start thinking about things in terms of premium and non-premium entries because not every move goes from polarity to polarity and when u see these things like non polarized moments getting targeted and creating polarity on the bottom

It's so fundamentally wrong to take a position that is so polarized like an origin level for example, and just say i want to make 2% on it, that would be foolish unless u have a very specific reason

Every time you enter a trade you have to start thinking about how polarized is this move on the larger scale of things vs this implied trading odd - how far could this thing go down&#x20;

\
The second u enter the trade its where u should start entering that queue of what are my implied trading odds like what makes sense here, for any level- if im taking this trade where does it fundamentally make sense to get out of this trade because having ur exit on that final hold created off your entry doesn't make sense
