# â˜¯ Active & Passive Contracts

Active positions are new positions opening and closing

A closing position/passive contract is someone taking profits

Most people exit at loss

Big players always have passive contracts open

The big players/best scalpers rebuy levels they TP on, there's always a contract open

A lack of longs to pull a move up after hitting a level means those longs will all start to exit which is what will break a move down cuz people start to panic and leave and then active shorts will happen

The longer a level holds, imagine how many people r gonna close their positions once the level collapses, so after holding a level for an hour and it collapses you'll have a huge move down

People that open contracts need to TP somewhere and if it stabilizes on its inverse people will close those shorts, so it's not that its pumping they're just taking profits [3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjg137bfK2E)
