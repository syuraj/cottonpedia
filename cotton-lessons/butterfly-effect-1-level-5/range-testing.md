# ↔ Range Testing

Ranges can have 2 tests (BS or FS) and after that range is gone

When one side of range is tested, the other side is also likely to be tested

## Example of a test

There can be test of this type only 2 times.

When FS of a range is broken, you are also likely breaking BS of bigger range
