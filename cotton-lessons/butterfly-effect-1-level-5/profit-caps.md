# ðŸ’² Profit Caps

## Capped Trade

Fixed target.

Identifying capped trade is easy.

1% in 1 min candle is justifiable but that may exist on that timeframe only

If you target a level that is not justifiable (e.g. outside of range), then you might miss target and lose money.

## Uncapped Trade

It can go anywhere.&#x20;

It doesn't have bound until it has reason to.
