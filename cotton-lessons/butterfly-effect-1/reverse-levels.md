# â†• Reverse Levels

When price wicks through a level that you're supposed to hold, that ends up being the greediest point in a move which also gives you your final hold

If you don't hard close the reverse level you actually don't lose the move and it becomes the final hold.

Reverse trends typically work on higher timeframes, not always but typically.

They are simple but are rarely used.

Any part of a hold level range that can technically a still ladder the move(Body of candle) - it can ladder off the body or the hold level
