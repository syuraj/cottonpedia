Any part of a hold level range that can technically a still ladder the move(Body of candle) - it can ladder off the body or the hold level

When u wick thru a level that ur supposed to hold, that ends up being the greediest point in a move, that ends up being ur greedy hold which also gives u ur final hold, final low

If u dont hard close the reverse level u actually dont lose the move and it becomes the final hold
