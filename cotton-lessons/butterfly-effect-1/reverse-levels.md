# â†• Reverse Levels

When u wick thru a level that ur supposed to hold, that ends up being the greediest point in a move, that ends up being ur greedy hold which also gives u ur final hold, final low

If u don't hard close the reverse level u actually don't lose the move and it becomes the final hold

Reverse trends typically work on higher timeframes, not always but typically.

They are simple but are rarely used.

Any part of a hold level range that can technically a still ladder the move(Body of candle) - it can ladder off the body or the hold level
