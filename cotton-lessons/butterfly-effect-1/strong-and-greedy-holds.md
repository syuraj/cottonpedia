#### Strong hold level

Strong hold level is going to have a strong reaction, its gonna come down touch the level and have a strong instant reaction afterwards (knife catch scenario, big bounce and/or quick move)

Strong reaction usually results in new higher high or lower low.

#### Greedy Hold level

Price will go after that level and attempt to continuously hold it over time through a trend. Its the greediest point in the move before the move starts to break, it's the best price before the move completely collapses down

Why do we call it greedy?- it's gonna be the greediest point in the move before the move starts to break the larger piece of what it's representing



A strong level is a backside hold and a greedy level is a frontside hold&#x20;

If the greedy hold cant hold the move its gonna break it down, it becomes the greediest point in the move to try and hold the move up

If strong level **stops having** strong reaction then the level is getting weaker.

If strong level stops holding, then it reaches greedy level which tries to hold and ultimately breaks.

Position trades should be from greedy hold levels as they are steady and might hold.

Strong level tends to create trend while Greedy level tends to create a ladder to trend.\


#### One more example with multiple Greedy levels and One strong Level
