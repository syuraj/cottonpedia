# 3âƒ£ Three Lanes Of Trading

TA, PA, CA

* Technical Analysis (Future of trading)
  * It ties everything together
* Procedural Analysis (Blueprint)
  * Before the trade
  * Mark all the levels
  * We need to start thinking of trades as Implied odds
  * Implied odds means how much you could potentially make in any given play given the risk involved
  * In extremely risky level, you have to do RA the hell out of that level.
* Comparative Analysis (Butterfly)
  * After the trade
* Risk Assessment (between BFE1 and BFE2)
  * During the trade - Assess risk of the trade while it is happening
  * Assess risk associated with each possible level

Once targets are hit, you are back into PA and then RA and CA.
