# 1⃣ +1/-1 theory

If 1H is hit at bottom, 4H i.e. (1H +1 timeframe) level rejection at top is required to break 1H below.

15M +1 => 1H

1H +1 => 4H

4H +1 => 1D



### -1 level

It is just a level that protects polarity&#x20;

If polarity is a 1 hour, a minus 1 would be a 15 minute above it (or below it for the inverse)
