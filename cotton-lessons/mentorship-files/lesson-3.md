# 3âƒ£ Lesson 3

You have many levels in a range.

Test of BS or FS is test of the Range.&#x20;

BS test will have strong reaction which indicates there may not be another chance to test.

FS test will have weaker reaction and could result in laddering

### Stronger level will go for a Stronger target

Similarly if greedier level gets attacked, it will target greedier target (e.g. trend in the pic below)

Trend strength depends on which part of the range it hits

In the pic below, after weaker reaction from a greedy level, it builds momentum after bouncing against trends and spikes through the range
