# 6⃣ Lesson 6

Information seekers are also isolators.

An information seeker needs to isolate the reasons of why something is happening. They find a piece of information on the chart and they try to justify that level and they don't have any vision outside of that level, they don't have any ability to be creative and say, well, what about the level above it? What happens if it hits this?&#x20;

Fear of failure comes from a lack of vision.

Vision is creativity, creativity and logic are kind of 2 cores of our brain so I say vision because I think it's more relatable on charts&#x20;

Cotton says creative people do the best in trading. He says he'd pick a guitar artist over a banker any day and he'll make them a pro trader.&#x20;

To reduce this fear of failure, you have to be less data-driven, you have to look at levels with no biases, just straight up neutrality - it's a tough thing to do.

Biases is the killer, biases is the creator of fear of failure. And fear of failure makes us miss trades. It's a vicious, dangerous cycle.

In charting we need to be more open minded about the possibilities that can happen. Every single moment in the chart that happens is like a moment of creativity is like an opportunity to be creative on the charts. I just said every moment is an opportunity to be creative on the charts so I make it sound like this thing where TA doesn't matter, of course it matters, it's the opportunity to be creative with new TA. So it gives you the opportunity to introduce more technicals on your chart.&#x20;

So creativity allows you to actually maximize your TA and the TA, the logic layer allows you to be accurate so it's like a beautiful balance between both creativity and logic



### Question: What's the trick to picking the level you should trade without having a bias&#x20;

Answer: You have to take emotion out, the trick isn't to make them all great. This is an exercise, let’s first be very clear on that, this is an exercise start marking all your levels as gray and see what happens, that's the exercise. The trick is to use both your emotion and intellect to have your levels marked out, intellectually make outcomes, but not let the bias of emotion dictate them like of its a 4hr but I think it's going to the daily - ofc were gonna do this its a natural process however let your mind run its logical path of natural selection because I think we can all agree that if we have 100% brain power it's better to use 95% of your brain power to make these decisions since it's such a technical field, this is all technical data which is all brain power, which is all intellect and logic flow and outcomes through logic.

### &#x20;Missed trade

Don't care, don't be upset, don't let emotions start to drive the wheel. This is another part where people start to fail.
